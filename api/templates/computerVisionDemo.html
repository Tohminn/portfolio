    The two videos below demostrate a Neural Network running alongside a custom tracking algorithm. The requirements for this project were to write a piece of distributable software that was able to hook into existing security cameras, track and count vehicles entering and exiting a parking lot, and report on those events in real time.

<b>Code Base</b>
<p>
    The software was mostly written in Python. Additional libraries were used to extract the video from the cameras over LAN and to publish the event messages. The detection was achieved using a trained Neural Network running on the Tensorflow framework via the Python API. The custom tracking was written by myself using physics-based relational algorithms. Utilizing this allowed quick setup and customization once relation was established with the camera perspective.

    While I cannot share the code base for the project, I am allowed to authorize you to view these video demostrations generated by it. The vehicles will get a green box when they are being 'watched' by the tracking algorithm. The box will turn blue while they are being actively tracked. When the algorithms have gained enough confidence on an object being tracked, it will increment the corresponding counter displayed in the upper left hand corner. These videos were generated in real time and sped up to enhance viewing experience.
