    The Image Annotator is a little Python program I wrote to help streamline the process of creating training data for a Neural Network. After starting the program, you would use the UI to select a folder of images. It would present the images to you and you could draw annotation bounding boxes on the images. For each annotation that was drawn, an entry would appear on a list on the right so that you could label the box and decide if you wanted it to carry forward to the next image (useful for stationary objects like parked cars). When you were done with all the images, you could click a button to export the annotations to a file in JSON format.

    As mentioned above, this program was written entirely in Python. The GUI was created using Python's built-in TkInter library.
